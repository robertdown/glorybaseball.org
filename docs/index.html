                        <p>GL‚öæÔ∏èRY BASEBALL comes from the reminder of who we serve. The founders include Bob Down, Joey Down and Mark Schanback. All three believe and trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.</p>
<p>The goals of this organization are lofty but the number one is to GIVE GOD GLORY in all that we do. The origin of the formation was to provide the baseball kids of THE GENEVA SCHOOL a player friendly, affordable, alternative to continue training their baseball skills. All three Founders have coached at the school.</p>
<p>The Geneva School allows the Organization to train during non-school hours using the facilities as long as the MIDDLE SCHOOL and VARSITY roster players train together. The prayer of Head Coach Bob Down after each Varsity game always included that we strive to do all we can to give God the glory.  So the name GL‚öæÔ∏èRY BASEBALL sets the bar high.
We ask your continuous prayer üôèüèº that our staff and players keep this goal in mind.</p>
<p>One of our rally cries is G3, or GIVE GOD GLORY ‚Ä¶ along with GL‚öæÔ∏èRY ! If we win a game, tournament, or lose just the same we can still give Glory to God. The intent of the training staff and coaching is to improve the chances of all the players to advance and thrive at the next level. The Geneva School is small but produced the Award Winner for Best Athlete in all private school Baseball in 2023 (Cam Lopez) and that gives GLORY TO GOD.
WE care about the athletes God sends our way.
It pleases us greatly to see improvements in their game and even greater satisfaction if their walk toward (and with)God grows.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> <strong>pray</strong>, win-or-lose, after every game.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> <strong>are competitive</strong> and like to win.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> expect players to <strong>train hard</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> expect players, coaches, parents to be flawed and <strong>make mistakes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> <strong>strive for perfection</strong> knowing it is unattainable but knowing the effort is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> promise to <strong>do our best</strong> to give players the opportunities they deserve to reach their maximum potential within a team concept.</p>
